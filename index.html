			<h2>Day 5: June 15, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>Today I started and finished chapter 7 of Flexbox Zombies which was all about the "flex-basis" property.</p>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>Today was a day full of travel so I did not get a lot of coding done. Once I got to my hotel, I went through chapter 7 of Flexbox Zombies and learned about the "flex-basis" property. I will probably need to go through it again. It seemed like it was explained thoroughly but I still don't firmly grasp it. It's a different way of setting height/width but is better somehow. I'm not sure exactly why but again, I'll probably need to repeat chapter 7.</p>

			<h2>Day 4: June 14, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>I had about three and a half hours of code today. It started with Flexbox Zombie, chapter 6 which covered the "flex-grow" and "flex-shrink" properties. I then spent the rest of the time figuring out how to add a countdown timer to my challenge page.</p>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>Chapter 6 in Flexbox Zombies was the hardest so far. Being able to tell the difference between how much an element grows compared to the other elements is a bit tricky. Not only that, but even after I had it down, something with the alignment would keep me from passing the test. It's not that I don't understand the alignment properties and how to use them. The problem is that I'm focused mostly on that particular chapter's lesson and forget about checking for the things covered previously. The JavaScript timer I added to this page would have been a challenge since I'm still far from comfortable with JavaScript. For this particular instance I chose to look up the code, copy/paste it, and then modify it to my liking. This is not how I want to get in the habit of coding but I plan on spending a lot of time on days 6-11 going back to my JavaScript lessons and hitting those hard. Also, as a sidenote, since I do most of my coding at night, it's a challenge to remember to push any of my code to Github before midnight and then my Github activity shows that I missed a day. I didn't...but it looks like I did. I need to get into the habit of making sure I push some of my work to Github before midnight.</p>

			<h2>Day 3: June 13, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>I spent an hour today working on chapter 5 in Flexbox Zombies which was focused on the "flex-grow" property. I also spent about five hours today building a complicated Excel workbook for my job. This workbook will build a growth plan for Exploring, the youth program I manage. The local office just has to enter a few current statistics and the workbook will give them all of the targets they need to reach.</p>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>It was pretty good and I got a decent grasp on it but the "stretch" align property still gets me most of the time. Today's Excel work was a lot of complex formulas and while that's not my main focus, it definitely flexed my "developer" mind so it definitely counts. I haven't done that in a long time and it was a lot of fun. I have a large list of goals for this challenge but learning more advanced Excel skills and even VBA programming is on my to-do list at some point.</p>

			<h2>Day 2: June 12, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>I spent my hour of code today on Flexbox Zombies. I finished through chapter four which means I've covered align-items, align-self, justify-content, and flex-direction.</p>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>I really enjoy practicing coding skills using games like Flexbox Zombie. The first game I played to learn Flexbox was Flexbox Froggy. Then I tried Grid Garden to get a handle on CSS grid. Flexbox Zombies is even better for Flexbox than Flexbox Froggies so I'd like to try the developer's next game, Grid Critters, but it costs $139. The rest of them are free. Oh well for now.</p>

			<h2>Day 1: June 11, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>Today is set-up day for this challenge. I have created a new Twitter account to join the "100 Days of Coding" Challenge and spent some time setting up this log. For this challenge, I have some goals:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Strengthen my knowledge of HTML. I have a good grasp of it but would like to learn more about proper element tags and meta tags.
				</li>
				<li>
					Strengthen my knowledge of CSS. I feel pretty comfortable with CSS but need to practice CSS Grid more to get a better understanding of responsive grids. I also need to learn more about media queries and some of the more advanced animations in CSS.
				</li>
				<li>
					Dive deeper into JavaScript. I have begun learning it but I do not have a good grasp of it and need to relearn some things and practice more.
				</li>
				<li>
					I want to learn about SVG images. It seems like a very powerful tool to have.
				</li>
				<li>
					I want to begin working on some personal projects that could become something larger as my knowledge increases. I do not want a portfolio full of calculators and to-do lists.
				</li>
				<li>
					I would like to start learning PHP. Most of the internet uses Wordpress and PHP is the appropriate language.
				</li>
				<li>
					I want to learn SQL. I enjoy working with databases and think this could be very interesting.
				</li>
				<li>
					I want to explore the development of Wordpress themes.
				</li>
				<li>
					I need to improve my aesthetic skills. i.e., typography, color theory, and UX design.
				</li>
				<li>
					I need more practice using Github so I can keep a good record of all code work.
				</li>
			</ol>
				<p>I will work through this challenge and accomplish these goals using a variety of sources and education, including:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Various Udemy courses, starting with Andrei Neagoie's "The Complete Web Developer in 2019: Zero to Mastery"
						</li>
						<li>
							Free Code Camp
						</li>
						<li>
							The Odin Project
						</li>
						<li>
							W3 Schools
						</li>
					</ul>
						I will also include in this log any milestones I reach during this challenge.
				</p>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>With full-time work that involves a lot of travel, a wife and two kids, and managing a Cub Scout pack full of little guys and girls, this challenge is going to be...a challenge. I have set a hefty list of goals above but I already have a headstart on HTML and CSS.</p>
			<p>Sidenote...this log is intentionally a very basic site. My coding focus will be elsewhere throughout the challenge.</p>
			<div id="milestone">
				<h3>Milestone</h3>
				<p>At the start of this challenge, I have already completed the Responsive Web Design Certification on <a href="www.freecodecamp.org">www.freecodecamp.org.</a></p>
