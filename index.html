			<h2>Day 2: June 12, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>I spent my hour of code today on Flexbox Zombies. I finished through chapter four which means I've covered align-items, align-self, justify-content, and flex-direction.</p>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>I really enjoy practicing coding skills using games like Flexbox Zombie. The first game I played to learn Flexbox was Flexbox Froggy. Then I tried Grid Garden to get a handle on CSS grid. Flexbox Zombies is even better for Flexbox than Flexbox Froggies so I'd like to try the developer's next game, Grid Critters, but it costs $139. The rest of them are free. Oh well for now.</p>

			<h2>Day 3: June 13, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>I spent an hour today working on chapter 5 in Flexbox Zombies which was focused on the "flex-grow" property. I also spent about five hours today building a complicated Excel workbook for my job. This workbook will build a growth plan for Exploring, the youth program I manage. The local office just has to enter a few current statistics and the workbook will give them all of the targets they need to reach.</p>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>It was pretty good and I got a decent grasp on it but the "stretch" align property still gets me most of the time. Today's Excel work was a lot of complex formulas and while that's not my main focus, it definitely flexed my "developer" mind so it definitely counts. I haven't done that in a long time and it was a lot of fun. I have a large list of goals for this challenge but learning more advanced Excel skills and even VBA programming is on my to-do list at some point.</p>

			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>Today is set-up day for this challenge. I have created a new Twitter account to join the "100 Days of Coding" Challenge and spent some time setting up this log. For this challenge, I have some goals:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Strengthen my knowledge of HTML. I have a good grasp of it but would like to learn more about proper element tags and meta tags.
				</li>
				<li>
					Strengthen my knowledge of CSS. I feel pretty comfortable with CSS but need to practice CSS Grid more to get a better understanding of responsive grids. I also need to learn more about media queries and some of the more advanced animations in CSS.
				</li>
				<li>
					Dive deeper into JavaScript. I have begun learning it but I do not have a good grasp of it and need to relearn some things and practice more.
				</li>
				<li>
					I want to learn about SVG images. It seems like a very powerful tool to have.
				</li>
				<li>
					I want to begin working on some personal projects that could become something larger as my knowledge increases. I do not want a portfolio full of calculators and to-do lists.
				</li>
				<li>
					I would like to start learning PHP. Most of the internet uses Wordpress and PHP is the appropriate language.
				</li>
				<li>
					I want to learn SQL. I enjoy working with databases and think this could be very interesting.
				</li>
				<li>
					I want to explore the development of Wordpress themes.
				</li>
				<li>
					I need to improve my aesthetic skills. i.e., typography, color theory, and UX design.
				</li>
				<li>
					I need more practice using Github so I can keep a good record of all code work.
				</li>
			</ol>
				<p>I will work through this challenge and accomplish these goals using a variety of sources and education, including:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Various Udemy courses, starting with Andrei Neagoie's "The Complete Web Developer in 2019: Zero to Mastery"
						</li>
						<li>
							Free Code Camp
						</li>
						<li>
							The Odin Project
						</li>
						<li>
							W3 Schools
						</li>
					</ul>
						I will also include in this log any milestones I reach during this challenge.
				</p>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>With full-time work that involves a lot of travel, a wife and two kids, and managing a Cub Scout pack full of little guys and girls, this challenge is going to be...a challenge. I have set a hefty list of goals above but I already have a headstart on HTML and CSS.</p>
			<p>Sidenote...this log is intentionally a very basic site. My coding focus will be elsewhere throughout the challenge.</p>
			<div id="milestone">
				<h3>Milestone</h3>
				<p>At the start of this challenge, I have already completed the Responsive Web Design Certification on <a href="www.freecodecamp.org">www.freecodecamp.org.</a></p>
