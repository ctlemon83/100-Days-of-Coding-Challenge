			<h2>Day 36: July 20, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>Day 36 was a great day for coding! I figured out how to keep the content of the quiz page hidden until a secure log-in was successful.</p>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>This has been a very satisfying few days for JavaScript! I had to play around quite a bit with figuring out how to keep the content hidden until the user successfully logged in. Here is what I've been working on: <a href="https://ctlemon83.github.io/scubaknowledge/" target="_blank">Scuba Knowledge Review</a>.</p>
		</div>

			<h2>Day 35: July 19, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>Coding today was mostly on paper. I added more detailed comments on my quiz app to keep my thoughts organized.</p>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>I'm trying to figure out how to build multiple quizzes using one JavaScript file without a ton of duplication. There are just a few constants that need to change depending on the quiz being taken. If I start a specific quiz, I need that "start" function to use one value for about three different constants and a different value for those constants if another quiz is started. I wasn't able to test it today but I've written it out and I am about 50% sure that it will accomplish what I want. I'll give it a try tomorrow hopefully. I can build the entire thing by just duplicating all of the JS and changing those constants for each one but that seems very unnecessarily repetitive.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="entry" id="day34">
			<h2>Day 34: July 18, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>More JavaScript today. I expanded on the secure log-in site I made yesterday.</p>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>Today I spent a few hours figuring out how to make my secure log-in site require unique user names. The process itself is probably not that impressive or even difficult for a seasoned JS coder but being new to this, it was very satisfying to figure this process out on my own. I also spent some time today writing out on paper the actions that need to be taken to continue building this site. I'm hoping that writing out the actions on paper will help to lay out all of the required functions in the JS.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="entry" id="day33">
			<h2>Day 33: July 17, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>Pure JavaScript today. I spent a couple hours building a site with the ability to add a new user and password and then log in with that new user and password.</p>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>This was fun and very satisfying! First of all, I finally got back to really working on JavaScript. I learned how to create a log in site as one of the projects in the "Complete Web Developer 2019" course by Andre but I expanded it by adding the ability to create new users. I got stuck on JavaScript before and it made me become an HTML/CSS recluse. Now that I've had a successful day of JavaScript...building a new action that I've never seen a tutorial on...it feels great! The thing works great but now I need to develop the content that a logged in user will be directed to. I will start that tomorrow.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="entry" id="day32">
			<h2>Day 32: July 16, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>I spent a few hours today continuing to develop the layout and content for the Cub Scout site. Specifically, I worked on the Den page and the Leader page.</p>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>For some reason, I still struggle somewhat with responsiveness when it comes to CSS Grid. It's getting better but it's pretty annoying. I did get a lot done on the layout though. Next I'm working on a MailChip contact form for the site and then I'll get to the last couple of pages. Tomorrow I will spend more time on the FreeCodeCamp curriculum as I try to get more familiar with JavaScript.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="entry" id="day31">
			<h2>Day 31: July 15, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>For JavaScript, I went through the "Intro to Debugging Challenges" section of FreeCodeCamp. I also went back to the Cub Scout site and spent quite a while setting up the layout of the home page and adding an imbedded Google calendar.</p>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>The debugging section of FreeCodeCamp went much smoother than some previous sections. I jumped ahead and took a look at the Roman Numeral Converter project in the last section of JavaScript. I wasn't able to do it but it doesn't seem as distant as I thought it would. I'll continue through the sections and keep looking at it every now and then.</p>
			<p>It is frustrating how much I sometimes struggle with layout. I feel like I have a good grasp of both Flexbox and Grid but I still have issues getting things to line up properly. I think it has more to do with the size of the content (specifically images) than anything but it's something I need to continue refining. I just have to try not to get too hung up on it and keep the JavaScript learning going.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="entry" id="day30">
			<h2>Day 30: July 14, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>Today I spent time working on the layout of the Cub Scout page. This is, I think, the 9th (and hopefully final) version of this site. I also spent time starting to build multiple scuba-related quiz site.</p>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>I missed two days due to family activity so I'm adjusting the countdown timer accordingly. I am looking forward to finishing the Cub Scout site since I've been through so many versions. Instead of putting a lot of effort into that today, I went back to working on my scuba quiz site. I started to build separate pages for each subject area quiz. One for scuba physics, one for underwater environment, etc. I built one of these using a tutorial which included a high scores page. That gave me a great start but now I'm going to have to figure some things out on my own. The tutorial just included one quiz and one page for high scores. My goal is to have multiple quizzes which all link to one high score pages that shows high scores for each quiz. Eventually, badges will be displayed based on the high score of each quiz. None of that was in the tutorial so I have to build the multiple-quiz high score page, edit the submission page for the username to record each high score, and determine how the high score page will display the badges that have been earned. Right now I'm using separate JS files for each quiz but I'd like to get to where it can all work from the same JS file and use unique identifiers for constants. I'll start with multiple files and when it's working, I'll start compiling it into one clean file. This project will take a while but should give me some great experience with JS!</p>
		</div>
		<div class="entry" id="day29">
			<h2>Day 29: July 11, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>Today I finished destructuring exercises in FreeCodeCamp and also went through the rest of the ES6 Challenges and all the way through Regular Expressions.</p>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>This is the most progress on FreeCodeCamp I've made in one day ever. Destructuring was tough but the Regular Expressions section went much smoother. It wasn't necessarily easy but I was able to get through most of the exercises without looking at the hints. I know I'm not absorbing all of this but the familiarity with the concepts is what is most important. The more I mess with it, the more I'll absorb.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="entry" id="day28">
			<h2>Day 28: July 10, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>I spent a lot of time going back to some basic JavaScript...building a log-in form using prompt, arrays, objects, and alerts. When the page is loaded, it prompts for a user name, then a password. If both match, an alert displays "Logged In!". If both do not match, an alert displays "Sorry, wrong credentials!".</p>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>It felt good to get back to some basic JavaScript since I've been away from practical JS exercises for a while. I built the log-in form fairly easily. What I wanted to do is have the page content hidden and with a successful login, the content would have a class added which changes visibility to visible. I was able to get it to work except with an incorrect log-in the content stayed visible until I clicked the "Okay" button on the "Sorry..." message. Then the content became visible. I'm not sure why that is happening but I'll keep working on it.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="entry" id="day25-27">
			<h2>Day 25-27: July 7-9, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>All coding the last few days was to make progress in the ES6 section of FreeCodeCamp.</p>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>This has been the most challenging section of the FreeCode Camp curriculum. Converting to ES6 JavaScript doesn't seem to be as easy as I think it should be. I've had particular difficulty with destructuring. I have one more destructuring exercise in the section so I look forward to finishing that ASAP. Once I do, I'll make myself go back through the destructuring exercises and see if I can get them down. I know I can...I just need more practice.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="entry" id="day23-24">
			<h2>Day 23-24: July 5-6, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>A lot of time was spent reviewing projects already started for quality layout. I am reorganizing the Cub Scout page because it has gotten a bit messy. I also spent some time reviewing some previously finished JavaScript modules in the "Complete Web Developer in 2019: Zero to Mastery" course. Specifically I went through Advanced Functions and Advanced Arrays. Finally, I reviewed the code from the quiz app.</p>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>I spent more time coding in these two days than I have in a while. I guess a lot of that time was spent reviewing material to get more familiar with it. I reviewed the quiz app code because it was done using a tutorial and I want to make sure I understand everything that needed to be done. When it comes down to it, I need to start building a new JavaScript project to get my brain in the JS game.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="entry" id="day21-22">
			<h2>Day 21-22: July 3-4, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>Over the last two days, I have spent a lot of time cleaning up existing projects like my portfolio, the scuba quiz, and my long-term "social network" project. I also built a "resume" page for my diving experience.</p>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>These two days have been more refining of my HTML and CSS skills. I'll say again...I really have to get back into learning JavaScript.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="entry" id="day15-20">
			<h2>Day 15-20: June 27-July 2, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>This is a report of progress for the past six days that I have missed updating this page and my Twitter. In that time, I did not complete the "Intro to ES6 Challenges" section of FreeCodeCamp but I did do several other things. I started building a prototype of a very long-term scuba diving project that I am planning. With that, I got more practice with building layout in CSS Grid and Flexbox, and expanded on the scuba quiz app by adding more questions and changing the styling.</p>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>I hated missing six days of reporting but I DID get a significant amount of coding practice in that time. I discovered a new resource today...CSS Grid Generator. I like the way CSS Grid works but keep struggling with making the layouts exactly what I want. This resource is awesome! I set the amount of rows and columns I want along with the grid gap and then literally drag out the layout for each of my divs. Once I have the overall layout I want, I click a button and it gives me the code needed for the parent element and divs. I don't want to lean on this to do my work for me but I do think it's a great way to learn CSS Grid more by building a layout and then analyzing the code that is generated to see how something is done. One problem I have had is trying to get a layout to work when I don't necessarily know how much room a section is going to take. This would happen when a biography section exists for a user to write in their profile but since each user would enter a different amount of text, the section would need to be flexible. I finally paid attention to the "overflow" property today and...problem solved! I can build the section at one set size and give it the ability to add a scroll bar if needed.</p>
			<p>Things are getting much easier with HTML and CSS but it really is time to dive back into JavaScript and start really getting ahold of it. Since a major project I'm planning is similar to a social network, I will probably get more comfortable with JavaScript and then start learning PHP for the backend.</p>

			<h2>Day 14: June 26, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>I was only able to spend an hour coding today and spent that working on the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. I worked on the "Introduction to ES6 Challenges" section.</p>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>I would like to finish this section of the curriculum this week. I haven't touched FreeCodeCamp in several weeks until today so I'd really like to get back into it. It's not necessarily the best teacher but it fills in gaps that aren't covered in some other programs plus gives me practice exercises with concepts that HAVE been covered.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="entry" id="day13">
			<h2>Day 13: June 25, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>Today I spent time experimenting with JavaScript. I'm trying to figure out how I will eventually display badges once criteria are met. I accomplished this using a click event but eventually want to use a minimum score reached on a particular quiz for the scuba platform I want to develop. I also spent some time going through Flexbox Froggies and Grid Garden.</p>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>This is the first time I've really tried something new in JavaScript without ANY tutorial. It was very satisfying to accomplish the task I had given myself, even if it's only a first step in a much bigger project. I also found myself thinking through how I would approach this particular task all the way home from work today. I've thought about coding before of course but this time I really was working out the problem so I would have a plan of attack when I got home.</p>
			<p>I have gone through both Flexbox Froggies and Grid Garden before but it has been a couple of months. This time, I went through both with no problem and not even a lot of thought. I feel like I am really mastering HTML and CSS. JavaScript is the next big goal and I'll start really feeling like a developer.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="entry" id="day12">
			<h2>Day 12: June 24, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>I finished the last two chapters of Flexbox Zombies today!</p>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>Although I'm still a little foggy on flex-basis, I think I'm pretty squared away on the other properties. I would love to try the developer's next game "Grid Critters" but that one's not free...it's $139. It's probably a great program but not something I can justify spending $139 on. Oh well...I have a decent grasp of CSS Grid right now so it's not a huge deal I guess.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="entry" id="day11">
			<h2>Day 11: June 22, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>Today I completed two chapters of Flexbox Zombies...only two to go before I'm finished. These two chapters covered the flex-wrap and align-content properties. On the Scuba Quiz, I added 12 more questions. I also experimented with making an image appear only if a specific checkbox is checked.</p>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>The two chapters of Flexbox Zombies were fairly straightforward. Flex-wrap is pretty easy to understand. Align-content took a little more thought to realize the difference between align-content and align-items but I think I've got it. I hope to finish the last two chapters tomorrow so that I will have completed the program.</p>
			<p>It was very satisfying to figure out the JavaScript experiment on my own. I used W3C Schools but only as a resource. I worked on this as part of a much larger project related to my scuba quiz. The plan is to develop the quiz so that with certain scores, the player will be awarded badges.</p>
			<p>Also...I added a day to the challenge because I was traveling home yesterday and didn't get to code at all. :-(</p>
		</div>
		<div class="entry" id="day10">
			<h2>Day 10: June 21, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>Today was all about finishing my first quiz app. I coded it to save and display the top five high scores. This was done using local storage. I tried to use JSON so I could keep the questions in a JSON file but that was a bit difficult. I also spent some time editing my portfolio page to include the scuba quiz.</p>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>I'm very happy to see the finished product...my scuba quiz! I learned a lot going this through project and have big plans to expand this into something even more awesome. I'm glad to finally have enough projects I'm happy with to post on my portfolio page. I still need to add my "100 Days of Coding" challenge log to my portfolio. I will probably do that tomorrow between trying to wrap up Flexbox Zombies chapters.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="entry" id="day9">
			<h2>Day 9: June 20, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>I worked on and finished chapter 8 of Flexbox Zombies today. This covered the "order" property of Flexbox.</p>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>The "order" property was much easier to grasp than flex-basis. It seems pretty straightforward. I wasn't able to work on much more than chapter 8 because of work commitments. Other than Flexbox Zombies, I spent a little time editing the code on this challenge page. Between learning JavaScript and finishing Flexbox Zombies, I'm going to figure out how to organize this challenge page so that instead of a big list of 100 days, it will be put into weeks.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="entry" id="day8">
			<h2>Day 8: June 19, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>Today I continued working on my quiz. I built the progress bar and now it not only keeps track of how many questions you've asked and how many are remaining, but also shows a green color when the answer is correct and a red answer when it's incorrect.</p>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>Building the progress bar and scorekeeper was not very difficult but I did have to go back and check some code when it wouldn't work correctly. I found that I was using an single quote where I should have been using the back tick mark instead. The quiz I'm building is just a simple four question quiz but I would like to expand that significantly. I'd like to make it a larger quiz...maybe 25 questions. I'd also like to build more quizzes that are related and connected. This one might be an entry level scuba diving quiz but the others could be on more specialized knowledge. With that, I want to learn how to build badges that can be earned depending on scores earned.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="entry" id="day7">
			<h2>Day 7: June 18, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>I spent a considerable amount of time today learning how to build a quiz game. I started with basic html and css to create the home and game pages and then worked with JavaScript to build the questions, scores, scorekeeper, etc.</p>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>I am following a tutorial on how to build a quiz but since he goes pretty fast, it forces me to stop and absorb everything we're going through to build this thing. Tomorrow is building a progress bar and then working out how to store high scores. Once I get this under control, I am going to turn this into a SCUBA quiz. Eventually, I will build quizzes for all levels of diving so students can test themselves when taking a particular certification. Making it relevant to my life/interests...this is how you make JavaScript learnable. :-)</p>
		</div>
		<div class="entry" id="day6.2">
			<h2>Day 6.2: June 17, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>Today there was no coding progress.</p>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>I worked on an Excel workbook today but most of it was formatting, not coding or formulas so I can't really count that. Then I had a long visit with family so there was no real coding today. That's okay...I'll add a day to the end of this challenge to make up for it.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="entry" id="day6">
			<h2>Day 6: June 16, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>I have returned to JavaScript. I went back to the "The Complete Web Developer in 2019: Zero to Mastery" course on Udemy. I rewatched the sections on function, objects, and arrays. I practiced with objects and arrays by doing something fun. I play Ultima Online (one of the few still playing 20+ years later) and thought it would be interesting to create some objects and arrays related to my character and some attributes. I created an object that included my character's name, skills, reputation, and race. I made "skills" and "reputation" into arrays. "Skills" has an array of the character's main skills (six skills) and each skill is an object that containts the properties "realskill" and "skillcap". "Reputation" has an array of two objects, "Fame" and "Karma", each with the properties "type" and "value". Here's a screenshot of the code:</p>
			<img src="uojava.png" alt="screenshot of code">
			<p>Once I had that built, I went into the Chrome console and started messing around with accessing the objects and arrays and combining them. I added a new property to the "reputation" objects which was "title" and gave it a "value". For "Fame" the value is "Lord" and for "Karma" the value is "The Distinguished". Then in the console I added them together along with the character's name and got "The Distinguished Lord Windarian Ktulu". Here is a screenshot of the console:</p>
			<img src="uoconsole.png" alt="screenshot of JavaScript console">
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>It was pretty fun to practice my JavaScript and console by creating something with a game I enjoy. I was especially proud of myself for remembering how to add properties to objects through the console. This exercise also gave me a new perspective on gaming. I started thinking about how everything in a game can be broken down into functions, objects, arrays, etc. If I want to cast a certain spell, there is a function that is checking my character's skill level, reagents available, mana level, the stats of the target, any stat modifiers the character might have, etc. It makes the idea of creating something like Ultima Online into something that might not be doable for me, but I can certainly understand better how it was put together.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="entry" id="day5">
			<h2>Day 5: June 15, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>Today I started and finished chapter 7 of Flexbox Zombies which was all about the "flex-basis" property.</p>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>Today was a day full of travel so I did not get a lot of coding done. Once I got to my hotel, I went through chapter 7 of Flexbox Zombies and learned about the "flex-basis" property. I will probably need to go through it again. It seemed like it was explained thoroughly but I still don't firmly grasp it. It's a different way of setting height/width but is better somehow. I'm not sure exactly why but again, I'll probably need to repeat chapter 7.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="entry" id="day4">
			<h2>Day 4: June 14, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>I had about three and a half hours of code today. It started with Flexbox Zombie, chapter 6 which covered the "flex-grow" and "flex-shrink" properties. I then spent the rest of the time figuring out how to add a countdown timer to my challenge page.</p>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>Chapter 6 in Flexbox Zombies was the hardest so far. Being able to tell the difference between how much an element grows compared to the other elements is a bit tricky. Not only that, but even after I had it down, something with the alignment would keep me from passing the test. It's not that I don't understand the alignment properties and how to use them. The problem is that I'm focused mostly on that particular chapter's lesson and forget about checking for the things covered previously. The JavaScript timer I added to this page would have been a challenge since I'm still far from comfortable with JavaScript. For this particular instance I chose to look up the code, copy/paste it, and then modify it to my liking. This is not how I want to get in the habit of coding but I plan on spending a lot of time on days 6-11 going back to my JavaScript lessons and hitting those hard. Also, as a sidenote, since I do most of my coding at night, it's a challenge to remember to push any of my code to Github before midnight and then my Github activity shows that I missed a day. I didn't...but it looks like I did. I need to get into the habit of making sure I push some of my work to Github before midnight.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="entry" id="day3">
			<h2>Day 3: June 13, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>I spent an hour today working on chapter 5 in Flexbox Zombies which was focused on the "flex-grow" property. I also spent about five hours today building a complicated Excel workbook for my job. This workbook will build a growth plan for Exploring, the youth program I manage. The local office just has to enter a few current statistics and the workbook will give them all of the targets they need to reach.</p>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>It was pretty good and I got a decent grasp on it but the "stretch" align property still gets me most of the time. Today's Excel work was a lot of complex formulas and while that's not my main focus, it definitely flexed my "developer" mind so it definitely counts. I haven't done that in a long time and it was a lot of fun. I have a large list of goals for this challenge but learning more advanced Excel skills and even VBA programming is on my to-do list at some point.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="entry" id="day2">
			<h2>Day 2: June 12, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>I spent my hour of code today on Flexbox Zombies. I finished through chapter four which means I've covered align-items, align-self, justify-content, and flex-direction.</p>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>I really enjoy practicing coding skills using games like Flexbox Zombie. The first game I played to learn Flexbox was Flexbox Froggy. Then I tried Grid Garden to get a handle on CSS grid. Flexbox Zombies is even better for Flexbox than Flexbox Froggies so I'd like to try the developer's next game, Grid Critters, but it costs $139. The rest of them are free. Oh well for now.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="entry" id="day1">
			<h2>Day 1: June 11, 2019</h2>
			<h3>Today's Progress</h3>
			<p>Today is set-up day for this challenge. I have created a new Twitter account to join the "100 Days of Coding" Challenge and spent some time setting up this log. For this challenge, I have some goals:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Strengthen my knowledge of HTML. I have a good grasp of it but would like to learn more about proper element tags and meta tags.
				</li>
				<li>
					Strengthen my knowledge of CSS. I feel pretty comfortable with CSS but need to practice CSS Grid more to get a better understanding of responsive grids. I also need to learn more about media queries and some of the more advanced animations in CSS.
				</li>
				<li>
					Dive deeper into JavaScript. I have begun learning it but I do not have a good grasp of it and need to relearn some things and practice more.
				</li>
				<li>
					I want to learn about SVG images. It seems like a very powerful tool to have.
				</li>
				<li>
					I want to begin working on some personal projects that could become something larger as my knowledge increases. I do not want a portfolio full of calculators and to-do lists.
				</li>
				<li>
					I would like to start learning PHP. Most of the internet uses Wordpress and PHP is the appropriate language.
				</li>
				<li>
					I want to learn SQL. I enjoy working with databases and think this could be very interesting.
				</li>
				<li>
					I want to explore the development of Wordpress themes.
				</li>
				<li>
					I need to improve my aesthetic skills. i.e., typography, color theory, and UX design.
				</li>
				<li>
					I need more practice using Github so I can keep a good record of all code work.

			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>With full-time work that involves a lot of travel, a wife and two kids, and managing a Cub Scout pack full of little guys and girls, this challenge is going to be...a challenge. I have set a hefty list of goals above but I already have a headstart on HTML and CSS.</p>
			<p>Sidenote...this log is intentionally a very basic site. My coding focus will be elsewhere throughout the challenge.</p>
